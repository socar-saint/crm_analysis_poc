# Common Packages

Shared building blocks for agents and MCP services.

- `core_common`: Minimal primitives (e.g., logging) that every service can rely on.
- `agent_common`: Agent-specific helpers layered on top of the core utilities.
- `mcp_common`: MCP-focused helpers layered on top of the same core utilities.
